Subject: [PATCH] u-boot-compulab: Don't run script if booting with Balena
 u-boot

The upstream Compulab u-boot script checks if the u-boot present in the second
partition matches the one on the boot devices and if not, updates
the latter and reboots the board, causing a bootcount increment. And this causes
issues when booting in a new OS after the hostOS update.

Let's not run this script when booting a BalenaOS
u-boot.

Upstream-status: Inappropriate [configuration]
