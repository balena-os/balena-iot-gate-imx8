                The /sys/class/gpio interface is bound to be removed anytime so
                let's

                not use it anymore. Instead just make the test set the pin to
                high then

                check its value after reboot then set the pin to low and check
                its value

                again after the next reboot.


                Also, when checking the pin value in /sys/kernel/debug/gpio lets
                search

                for the gpio using the GPIO label instead of grepping for a gpio
                number

                because various kernel versions may offset the gpios with a
                base.

                The AWS environment is always tied to the balenaCloud deploy
                environment so exposing this to the device workflows is only
                potential for issues, and no benefit.

                For the time being, the deploy environment will contain
                both the AWS and BC vars and secrets.

                This allows more granular control over which environments are
                used

                for which steps, and avoids requiring a single environment to
                define

                how to build, sign, and publish.


                This is better for security as it allows each job to only have

                the secrets it needs, and not all secrets for all steps.


                We retain backwards compatibility by falling back to the
                original

                monolith environment input for now.

                When signed images are used without opting in secure boot, we
                don't want

                the encrypted mount service to run and fail as there is no
                encrypted

                boot partition.


                This commit adds a condition to the encrypted boot mount service
                to only

                run if the encrypted boot partition exists, similarly to what is

                already done for EFI builds.

                duplicate fields.


                This allows to have multiple device types that build the same
                machine,

                for example if they have different feature layers.

                but has other patches applied to it.


                The wpa_supplicant version from Kirkstone is from Poky revision

                be48ef3d1bab50824c6678748bcfa897a2a6ca8a


                This fixes auth issues we have seen on a Jetson TX2.

                We encountered the variance in expected and measured swap in the
                rpi5 to be higher than the allowed value of 10 - to make this
                safe and allowing of more device types, changed the allowed
                variation - still small enough to actually check the value is
                right, but should reduce false negatives

                Tests can get stuck here for 15 to 20 minutes if the timings are
                unlucky. Forcing a supervisor restart ensures a clean slate and
                ensures that the variables are included as quickly as possible

                Since 1ae37ac158b93df836126030abec8c3d3f69d92b using the flasher
                image with secureboot and preloading doesn't work. Skipping
                preloading tests will unblock users not using this combination

                2.108.6 doesn't exist for generic-amd64. The tests used to still
                work, because we werent acually passing the version to
                kernel-module-build correctly, meaning that it would default to
                the one in the kernel-module-build project. That was fixed in
                4484c59fc924100232cc10303a4636ed0082760a , and now we are
                passing the version correctly, we're looking for a nonexistant
                version. Changing version to match the default.

                        Support for v20 will be removed on a future version.

                        the only way to

                        modify application and configuration.

                for the iot-gate-imx8. The iot-gate-imx8plus needs
                one as well because it's now using the meta-balena-hab
                submodule.

                the balenaCloud device type.


                This allows to build the same machine but deploy to a different

        The iot-gate-imx8-sb workflow builds an iot-gate-imx8 with secure boot
        support, the machine is still iot-gate-imx8, but it's meant to deploy
        to its own iot-gate-imx8-sb device type as the original iot-gate-imx8
        device type rootfs does not fit the secure boot support and there is
        no migration path at the moment.

        However, it's desired to keep this a single machine as once there is a
        migration path the same device type will support both secure boot and
        non secure boot enabled variants.

                The signed image symlink is not generated before the flasher needs it so we avoid this dependency issue by
                defining a new image type for which the build system will automatically create the appropriate symlink.

                The altboot test often hangs for a long time during the altboot
                test, after the DUT has booted into the old OS after the altboot
                failure - the check to see if the rollback systemd services have
                stopped hangs. This is an attempt to fix that, as I think
                there's some strange interaction going on with the while loop
                over ssh

                By default barys assumes there is only one integration layers
                and looks

                for the custom sample templates in there. This might not be the
                case

                if there are feature layers like adding secure boot support, so
                this

                commit allows to specify which layer to look the sample
                templates from.

              hash: cad0b71d6a2b26ff90d6ae5b0f8247c4b3237479
              body: >
                Secure boots builds used to end up with a mismatch between the
                kernel

                and modules signatures because of the use of cache - to avoid
                this we

                temporarily forced builds without cache.


                With the fix in meta-balena
                389054e84c0b1fd382d737c39fb2bb02c2b3e9b2,

                kernel modules are always set not to use cache and this problem
                should

                no longer happen.


                At least during the i.MX secure boot local builds with cache
                never hit

                the problem.


                Remove the setting not to use cache.

                At this moment balena-image-flasher depends on
                do_image_sign_digest

                and do_rootfs of balena-image, but this is not enough, as the
                signature

                symlink is only created by a postprocess script.


                This patch replaces the two existing dependencies by
                do_image_complete,

                which should cover everything.

                      hash: 8e6c0fcad729b56e386ac27754c48c97517e293a

                        This fixes a regression where dependencies would only be started in
                        order and would start the dependent service if its dependency had been
                        started at some point in the past, regardless of the running condition.

                        This makes the behavior more consistent with docker compose where the
                        [dependency needs to be
                        running or healthy](https://github.com/docker/compose/blob/69a83d1303a103d82b05d512baf273244b4dbd94/pkg/compose/convergence.go#L441) for the service to be started.

                    - subject: Enable selection of workers with locked DUT in secureboot tests

                      body: >
                        This will make the client look for workers with a "DUT:
                        <deviceType>-sb" tag if FLASHER_SECUREBOOT=1 when
                        starting tests. This is to enable differentiation
                        between locked and unlocked DUTs for device types that
                        support secureboot.

                MBR systems or `/EFI/BOOT` for EFI ones.

                For the first deployment of the S3 download mirror we will
                err on the side of cost savings, and use the mirror as a
                fallback not the primary source of downloads.

                Revert this if we want the benefits of using our own mirrors
                as the primary source, like download speed and no rate limits.

                errors,

                for example when the initramfs fail() is called allowing the
                device to

                reboot and rollback.

              hash: 1ae37ac158b93df836126030abec8c3d3f69d92b
              body: >
                At this moment resin-init-flasher just takes whatever image lies
                in /opt

                and dd's it to the target drive. This is fine for general use,
                but with

                secure boot enabled, we want to perform at least basic
                authentication

                of the image being written.


                This patch gets the image signed at build time and makes flasher
                verify

                the signature against a key built-in the kernel trust store. At
                this

                very moment it fails hard if the signature does not match, but
                this may

                change in the future. Technically we only want to know if we are
                about

                to flash a balena-provided image or not, we might want to
                support both

                but behave slightly differently in each scenario.

                        os.power and os.fan subfields under the "os" key, in
                        order

                        to set power and fan configs. The expected format for
                        os.power

                        and os.fan settings is:

                        ```

                        {
                          os: {
                            power: {
                              mode: string
                            },
                            fan: {
                              profile: string
                            }
                          }
                        }

                        ```


                        There may be other keys in os which are not managed by
                        the Supervisor,

                        so PowerFanConfig backend doesn't read or write to them.
                        Extra keys in os.power

                        and os.fan are ignored when getting boot config and
                        removed when setting

                        boot config.


                        After this backend writes to config.json, host services
                        os-power-mode

                        and os-fan-profile pick up the changes, on reboot in the
                        former's case

                        and at runtime in the latter's case. The changes are
                        applied by the host

                        services, which the Supervisor does not manage aside
                        from streaming

                        their service logs to the dashboard.

                Instead, if the NFS is available it will be used
                as a read-only mirror for shared downloads,
                but will not be updated with new files.

      body: |
        The flasher script in meta-balena calls `poweroff` and expects it to
        fail if the device cannot be powered off. However on this device type
        the call returns success but the device is not powered off.

        This commit uses a custom shutdown that effectively shuts down this
        device type.

                Make sure the bootcount comparison only takes place if bootcount

                been set.

                Right now if the flashing script errors out the initramfs just
                keeps

                running modules. This is a security risk specially for secure
                boot

                systems as at that point we have an authorized trusted OS
                running in

                an unvetted path.


                This commit exits init if the flasher returns, and also attemps
                to crash

                the kernel followed by an infinite sleep for paranoic reasons.

                the supervisor

                can check this metadata against the equivalent field from
                /etc/os-release to

                determine if the device is already running the latest OS
                release.

                        is the default Docker bridge which is used for

                        don't have a custom bridge. However, the Supervisor
                        creates a

                        mode is

                        specified.

                        Resolve an issue in balenaMachine instances that were
                        installed at <v14.1.0,

                        in which a Supervisor app with random UUID is kept in
                        the target db due to its appId

                        being the same, even after the BM instance has upgraded
                        to v14.1.0 which patches

                        the correct reserved Supervisor app UUIDs in. This
                        results in two Supervisors running

                        on devices under the BM instance which persists after BM
                        upgrade.

                        On NXP iMX devices the partitions are not encrypted with
                        LUKS but with

                        the lower level dm-crypt subsystem.


                        Adapt the partition mount script to use dmsetup which
                        works for both

                        LUKS and dm-crypt encrypted partitions.

                        Debian no longer publishes linux/arm/v5 images for

                        support for raspberry pi zero.


                        This change might not solve the issue indefinitely

                        as we don't know how long debian will continue
                        publishing armv5 images.

                        This moves from throwing an error when an app is
                        rejected due to unmet

                        requirements (because of contracts) to storing the
                        target with a

                        `rejected` flag on the database.


                        The application manager filters rejected apps when
                        calculating steps to

                        prevent them from affecting the current state. The state
                        engine uses the

                        rejection info to generate the state report.

        The :remove bitbake keyword is meant to do word removals and here it is
        used to remove a whole line, which works, but could break at any time.

        Replace by a prepend that defines the missing variables to fix the
        original install task.

                Secure boot enabled partitions need to split the boot partition
                into

                an encrypted and a non-encrypted one.


                Unless the device type natively separates the files that the
                bootROM

                needs to boot, like EFI does into /mnt/boot/EFI, a list of files
                to

                move to the non-encrypted partition needs to be provided on the

                BALENA_NONENCRYPTED_BOOT_PARTITION_FILES variable, and a
                function

                to implement the split needs to be provided.


                This commit introduces a split_bootpartition() function that
                performs

                this and can be used for those platforms that need to list the
                boot

                essential files in a BALENA_NONENCRYPTED_BOOT_PARTITION_FILES
                variable.


                This is typically called from the bootpart_split() function in
                the

                balena-init-flasher customization file.

              hash: d1deb3e4fc8744fe66e1b5a726c82b4a856f2fe4
              body: >
                On secure boot enabled devices the boot partition is split into
                an

                encrypted boot partition (/mnt/boot) and a non-encrypted boot
                partition

                (/mnt/<name>).


                On the built rootfs all files live in `/mnt/boot`, and the
                installation

                needs to create an encrypted /mnt/<name> and move some files
                from

                /mnt/boot there.


                UEFI platforms make this easy as the non-encrypted files are
                stored on a

                different /mnt/boot/EFI folder. However, other platforms need to
                list

                which files to move by name.


                This commit introduces a skip_nonencrypted_boot_files() helper
                function

                for these other platforms to use.


                It is typically called from a do_skip() function in the
                os-helpers-sb

                secure boot customization file.

                The existing method of using labels allows for
                Actions Time Of Check to Time Of Use (TOCTOU) attacks
                because we do not associate the label with any commit.

                This action requires approvals via reactions on a unique
                comment generated for each workflow run.

    - subject: allow abroot to detect an unbootable rollback and fix it up
      hash: 3c894fded47f24cb042480923fccb3ea1f2b0cd1
      body: >
        The current linux-compulab kernel freezes when booting from kexec as

        the ocotp clocks are accessed before being enabled - this is a problem

        when trying to rollback from altboot failed HUP to a balena bootloader
        enabled

        image as the old kernel will freeze on the kexec.


        This commit adds a rollback function that on partition switch reinstates

        the old OS U-boot which bypasses the balena bootloader.

                Rather than run the suites in series, or require building the

                image twice, we can allow the test matrix to define separate
                runs

                for the two modes.

                This service needs to be restarted every time the
                fan profile is modified in config.json, so that
                it can apply the change and restart the device
                specific fan control daemon. This is unlike the
                power model service, which only runs once, at startup.

              body: |
                At this moment the abroot script assumes that the boot partition
                is already in place when it executes. This might not be true
                if the rootfs sits on a device that takes a while to initialize,
                such as a USB drive. The script fails hard if that is the case.

                This patch replicates a waiting loop from the rootfs script,
                which addresses the same issue for systems that do not use
                the balena bootloader.

                A previous commit added quotes to some of the `balena deploy`
                command args - when $status or $_debug aren't defined, this
                means empty quote gets passed as an arg, making the CLI fail.

                is related to a PCO setting:

            - subject: "initrdscripts: replace cut by awk for parsing lsblk in cryptsetup
                hook"
              hash: c9544aaf502943f3b492d0a5907f1c1e401c6ac7
              body: >
                cut is sensitive to the amount of delimiter characters when
                parsing

                output, so e.g. an additional space between two elements causes

                every field shift by one index.


                This patch replaces the use of cut by awk, which should be more
                robust.

                This patch adds a set of checks that make sure that the
                partition

                layout is as expected on a system with encrypted disks. Namely
                it

                * Checks that the boot partition is split

                * Checks that it can find the correct amount of encrypted
                partitions

                * Checks that the label on the unlocked filesystem matches the
                label
                  on the encrypted partition
                * Checks that system is not mixing encrypted and unencrypted
                  partitions
                * Checks there are no ambiguities or duplicit partitions

                We currently have many `8cpu` runners available that are

                migrating from Jenkins that we should allow to use for yocto
                builds.


                As long as some runners don't have the `yocto` tag so we don't
                bottleneck the runner queue for other orgs.

                When this config.json field has a value, the supervisor will
                treat the device as managed and will crash and start to boot

                On faster device-types we don't seem to notice and the tests
                pass by chance, but on Pi Zero and similar we consistently see

                        Users may specify dnsu2t config by including a `dns`
                        field

                        in the `proxy` section of PATCH /v1/device/host-config's
                        body:

                        ```

                        {
                          network: {
                            proxy: {
                              dns: '1.1.1.1:53',
                            }
                          }
                        }

                        ```


                        If `dns` is a string, ADDRESS and PORT are required and
                        should be

                        in the format `ADDRESS:PORT`. The endpoint with error
                        with

                        code 400 if either ADDRESS or PORT are missing.


                        `dns` may also be a boolean. If true, defaults will be
                        configured.

                        If false, the dns configuration will be removed.


                        If `proxy` is patched to empty, `dns` will be removed
                        regardless

                        of its current or input configs, as `dns` depends on an
                        active

                        redsocks proxy to function.

                        The following pattern

                        ```ts

                        async function longRunning() {
                           // do something
                           await setTimeout(delay);
                           await longRunning();
                        }

                        ```


                        Is regularly used for long running operations on the
                        supervisor (e.g.

                        polling target state). We have

                        recently discovered that this pattern can slowly leak
                        memory as it

                        essentially creates an infinite promise chain. Using
                        `void longRunning()` breaks

                        the chain and avoids the issue.


                        This commit fixes all those instances where the pattern
                        was used.

                        The balena logging backend now uses async functions to
                        setup the

                        connection and write messages to the request stream.
                        This adds some

                        backpressure on `log` calls by by the log monitor
                        module, to prevent a

                        very agressive container causing the supervisor to waste
                        CPU cycles just

                        dropping messages.

                        This removes the dependence of the supervisor on the
                        containerLogs

                        database for remembering the last sent timestamp. This
                        commit instead

                        uses the supervisor startup time as the initial time for
                        log retrieval.

                        This might result in some logs missing for services that
                        may start

                        before the supervisor after a boot, or if the supervisor
                        restarts.

                        However this seems like an acceptable trade-off as the
                        current

                        implementation seems to make things worst in resource
                        contrained

                        environments.


                        We'll move storing the last sent timestamp to a better
                        storage medium in

                        a future commit.

                The "All jobs" job is used for branch protection
                as it captures the overall success/fail of all
                the test matrices and build.

                However without a unique name we are unable
                to identify the device type in order to mark it as required.

                This change adds a single instance matrix
                to the build job and as a result will append the machine
                name and deploy environment in the job name.

                        the function that was being used to fetch the DUT ip
                        from the worker had nested retries that led to 30x5 =
                        150 retries, and timeouts taking ~40 mins in the case
                        the DUT wasn't reachable (autokit setup fault, device
                        not booting, problem during flashing). This removes the
                        nested retries and reduces the retries to 50 /  ~ 10mins

                With the update to ModemManager version 1.22.0 we now have some
                Quectel modems failing

                to use QMI properly:


                ModemManager[1178]: [modem0] power state updated: on

                ModemManager[1178]: [modem0] (quectel) modem reset detected,
                triggering reprobe

                ModemManager[1178]: [modem0] (quectel) modem reset detected,
                triggering reprobe

                .

                .

                .

                ModemManager[1178]: [modem0] failed waiting for final state: Too
                much time waiting to get to a final state

                ModemManager[1178]: [modem0] failed enabling modem: Operation
                was cancelled

                ModemManager[1178]: [modem1] couldn't start initialization:
                Transaction timed out

                ModemManager[1178]: [modem1] fatal error initializing: Fatal
                error: modem is unusable


                This has been fixed upstream with the 2 patches we backport
                here:


                ModemManager[1139]: [modem0] power state updated: on

                ModemManager[1139]: [modem0] (quectel) continuing without

                when building + deploying or a private DT , the check to see if the DT is private fails. This is due to https://github.com/balena-os/balena-yocto-scripts/blob/master/automation/include/balena-api.inc#L424 using this function: https://github.com/balena-os/balena-yocto-scripts/blob/master/automation/include/balena-lib.inc#L191 - which uses the jenkins deployTo variable to select the correct api url and token.

                        immediately"

                        There is a problem where if the multiple jobs are
                        running at the same time, all waiting for a worker to be
                        IDLE, multiple jobs start using the worker at the same
                        time. The reason was that first, the state of the worker
                        is polled using /state - then, after some delay, it is
                        reserved using the /start endpoint. Problem 1 was that
                        there is a delay between checking and reserving -
                        leading to a window of time where another job could do
                        the same thing. Problem 2 is that once /start was used,
                        there was nothing to stop the client from continuing,
                        even if the worker was BUSY. This commit forgoes the
                        /state endpoint, and just skips to trying /start - if
                        the worker is IDLE, its instanly reserved, if its BUSY,
                        the reponse is actually checked and nothing happens.

                Sometimes on NetworkManager restart a new rule for a shared

                is added, but the old rule is not cleaned up properly, so the
                rules

                are just piling up. This patch makes the shared dispatcher
                script

                clean up duplicates if it finds any.

                Use the flasher configuration file to specify the post-install
                action.


                This is to shutdown (the default) when the flasher runs from an
                external

                media, or to reboot when running from the same media as is the
                case for

                the migrator tool.


                Also, assert that a locked device can only install from memory.

                Traditionally after programming the flasher image would shutdown
                the

                device to allow for the removal of the external device and
                booting from

                the internal storage.


                As more use case appeared, like programming from the initramfs
                when the

                flasher image runs on the same target device it will program,
                the post

                install action needs to support rebooting instead as physical
                access to

                the device to power on cannot be expected. This is the case for
                remote

                migration, AMI VM installs and also secure boot installs.


                The current code just checks for the existence of the `shutdown`
                command

                which is not present on the initramfs to decide whether to
                shutdown or

                reboot.


                This commit improves that logic by defaulting to shutdown but
                allowing the

                configuration file to specify a reboot instead.


                Also, it improves the robustness of the reboot/shutdown by
                falling down

                to sys-rq, and provides a way to override the reboot/shutdown by
                device

                layers that require it.

                        v4 and the custom typings were actually masking some
                        bugs

                        The host-config module exposes the following interfaces:
                        get,

                        patch, and parse.


                        `get` gets host configuration such as redsocks proxy
                        configuration

                        and hostname and returns it in an object of type
                        HostConfiguration.


                        `patch` takes an object of type HostConfiguration or
                        LegacyHostConfiguration

                        and updates the hostname and redsocks proxy
                        configuration, optionally

                        forcing the patch through update locks.


                        `parse` takes a user input of unknown type and parses it
                        into type

                        HostConfiguration or LegacyHostConfiguration for
                        patching, erroring if

                        parse was unsuccessful.


                        LegacyHostConfiguration is a looser typing of the user
                        input which does

                        not validate values of the five known proxy fields of
                        type, ip, port,

                        username, and password. We should stop supporting it in
                        the next

                        major Supervisor API release.

                        Once input has been determined to be of type

                        stringifying, and writing to redsocks.conf.

                        This fixes a regression on the supervisor state engine
                        computation

                        (added on v16.2.0) when

                        the target state removes a network at the same time that
                        a service

                        referencing that network is changed. Example going from


                        ```

                        services:
                           one:
                              image: alpine: 3.18
                              networks: ['balena']

                        networks:
                           balena:
                        ```


                        to


                        ```

                        services:
                           one:
                              image: alpine: latest
                        ```


                        Would never reach the target state as killing the
                        service in order to

                        remove the network is prioritized, but one of the
                        invariants in the target state calculation is

                        to not kill any services until all images have been
                        downloaded. These

                        two instructions were in contradiction leading to a
                        deadlock.


                        The fix involves only adding removal steps for services
                        depending on a

                        changing network or volume if the service container is
                        not being removed

                        already.

                At this moment the kexec initrd script is skipped when
                ROOTFS_DIR

                is not defined or if the new rootfs is mounted, but does not
                contain

                a kernel image in the expected place. This is undesirable as we

                assume this is the last script executed by the balena
                bootloader.


                This patch makes the kexec script always execute in the balena

                bootloader and makes it fail hard in unexpected states, which
                means

                the script is always an exit point for the balena bootloader,

                whether the actual kexec call succeeds or not.

              hash: 02d42d3cc887fb761da348f86bf5e13f1dacaeb2
              body: >
                At this moment the kexec initrd script just takes the original
                kernel

                command line, replaces root with UUID and removes bootloader
                args.


                We have found at least one use-case (on the Pi4 and firmware
                GPIOs),

                where a different initrd script needs to pass extra arguments

                to the kexec'd kernel. With this patch it will append the
                contents

                of the KEXEC_EXTRA_ARGS variable to the kernel command line.

                In 328222014146f0116e0208443f3e255d0e85ef15 we have removed

                the signed-update hook from systems that do not have EFI

                in MACHINE_FEATURES. This on its own makes sense, however
                together

                with it we have also removed the runtime check for whether the
                running

                system is actually booted in UEFI mode.


                This effectively means it is no longer possible to update the
                host OS

                on a device type able to boot in both UEFI and BIOS modes

                (intel-nuc and genericx86-64-ext) when booted in BIOS mode,

                as the signed-update hook is executed unconditionally and fails

                if the device is not running UEFI.


                This patch re-adds the runtime check to only execute the hook

                if the system is actually booted in UEFI mode.

                which we

                mixed a test for string length with a test for string equality.

                The include syntax allows full control over settings used

                in each test job, but the combinatorial is simpler to write

                for basic use cases.


                Rather than force one, we can allow both and default to the
                simple

                syntax.


                Marking as minor since the input syntax has changed, but isn't

                currently used in production anywhere.

                used for each test job without combinatorial explosion.

                For example, different environments could be used for
                specific test suites, or the cloud suite could be run
                twice while the other suites run once.

                        This goes in the direction of grouping modules by
                        responsibility. The

                We have detected one more way in which the uuid file used by
                containerd

                can get corrupted. This time, the file is not empty, but doesn't
                contain

                a valid UUID either.


                This commit thus extends the existing workaround to also handle
                this

                case.

                tcgtool will improperly read zero bytes from efivar files. This

                unbootable

                Read the file contents, skipping the first four bytes that are

                attributes, and pipe the data directly to tcgtool to work around
                this.

                The 0-signed-update hook, which updates the sealing policy for
                secure

                boot enabled systems, reads from the securityfs mounted at

                /sys/kernel/security in order to parse the TPM event log.


                If this filesystem isn't mounted, the hook will improperly
                detect that

                the TPM event log isn't available, and unneccessarily create a
                combined

                policy when a single PCR policy would suffice.


                Mount this filesystem in old_rootfs before chrooting to fix
                this.

                In commit 1c19ebb, we append digests from the TPM event log

                corresponding to events that are logged before EV_SEPARATOR. For

                instance, parsing the event log on a typical system for event
                types, the

                output looks like this:


                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (SecureBoot)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (PK)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (KEK)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (db)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (dbx)

                EV_SEPARATOR


                This system requires no merging of event log digests.


                On systems that measure EFI binaries (mostly only QEMU w/ edk2),
                we also

                get this:


                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (SecureBoot)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (PK)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (KEK)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (db)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (dbx)

                EV_SEPARATOR

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_AUTHORITY (bootx64.efi)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_AUTHORITY (bzImage)


                Again, this requires no merging. We compute the signature of the

                relevant EFI binaries ourselves, as they're subject to change
                during

                hostapp-update.


                However, we've also seen event logs like this:


                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (SecureBoot)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (PK)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (KEK)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (db)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (dbx)

                EV_EFI_ACTION (DMA Protection Disabled)

                EV_SEPARATOR


                This case is the one we've handled previously, by reading from
                the event

                log and appending event digests before EV_SEPARATOR. We stopped
                at

                EV_SEPARATOR because we weren't parsing event types previously,
                and this

                digest is a constant that's easily recognized. However, we've
                since

                encountered systems that have unexpected events *after*
                EV_SEPARATOR, as

                shown below.


                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (SecureBoot)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (PK)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (KEK)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (db)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (dbx)

                EV_SEPARATOR

                Unknown event type (?!)


                In order to handle this, parse digests and event types into
                temporary

                files and iterate through them together. We only stop appending
                digests

                from the event log when the next event type is
                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_AUTHORITY

                (EFI binary signature) or we hit the end of the list. This
                should

                account for all possible variations.

                machines that need to use a driver for this WiFi chipset can

                All public Jetson Orin based device-types have just been updated
                to L4T 35.5.0,

                thus we need to update the base images to use the updated L4T
                repositories.


                We also add the distro configs for the upcoming Orin Nano 4GB
                Seeed J3010

                device-type.

                Mentioning that this is a 4GB RAM Orin Nano module in the name.

                The carrier board appears to be very close to the Devkit, so
                this

                image may be used with other carrier boards if they are
                compatible.

              hash: ab8d61194d84045e4b74f60e4172a69dd52a3509

                Manipulating the firewall rules by index introduces a race
                condition.

                Both NetworkManager and balenaEngine add the rules to the top

                of the FORWARD chain instead of appending, so if we first look
                up

                a rule by number and then use the number to refer to it, we can
                not

                guarantee that the rule number has not changed (iow the rule has
                not

                been moved down) in the meantime.


                This patch removes the use of rule numbers completely and makes

                the "shared" dispatcher script refer to the rules by definition.

                This is a fix targeted for the revpi-connect-4 which requires a

                we did this test results in the config.txt being wiped - so now

                        io-ts type validation breaking, due to a change in

                        of decoding unknown objects. In <2.2.21, a record with a
                        custom key type

                        will decode an unknown object to Left if it has a key is
                        not of the custom

                        type. Whereas in io-ts@2.2.21, t.record will strip the
                        invalid key and

                        decode to Right. This is a breaking change for us.

                        The `mdns-resolver` module does not provide a default
                        export. Trying to

                        use a default import notation, causes the `resolve`
                        function to not be

                        found, breaking MDNS resolution.

                        Since HTTP's server.close() is async, there is a slim
                        chance

                        for two instances of /v1/reboot or /v1/shutdown to be
                        processed.

                        If the server is already closed when server.close() is
                        called,

                        the call throws ERR_SERVER_NOT_RUNNING

                        which doesn't need to be surfaced to the user. This
                        change

                        only allows one server.close() attempt to occur at a
                        time.

                        The Supervisor should only care whether a lockfile
                        exists or

                        not. This also fixes an edge case where a user symlinked
                        a lockfile

                        to a nonexistent file, causing the Supervisor to enter
                        an error

                        loop as it was not able to `stat` the nonexistent file.

                        io-ts types that were generated using
                        `shortStringWithRegex` were testing

                        against `VAR_NAME_REGEX`, instead of the Regex that was
                        specified when

                        generating the type. This affected `DockerName` such
                        that service names with

                        a dash in the middle were returning as false when passed
                        through the

                        `DockerName.is` type guard, affecting how
                        `getServicesLockedByAppId` was

                        returning a map of locked services.

                This commit introduces a command line argument override for
                board

                integration layers to use. This allows for example for
                non-flasher device

                types to force the migration.

                As soon as the UUID is regenerated udev runs the correspondign

                However, the rules expect the new UUID to be cached in a file,
                so there

                is a race condition between the creation of the file and the
                udev rule.


                This commit avoid the race condition by using a file mutex that
                the

                udev rule can wait on.

                Remounting filesystems is done on systems with a broken clock in
                order

                to prevent tune2fs from bailing out when the last mounted time
                is in the

                future. This resets the last mounted time to now.


                However, the filesystem is immediately unmounted again without
                being

                utilized, and the mount and unmount process is time consuming.
                Instead,

                A missing semi-colon caused the firmware_measures_efibins
                function to

                return an exit code of one, which the 0-signed-update
                hostapp-update

                hook interpreted as "this firmware does not measure EFI binaries
                into

                PCR 7", as opposed to zero, indicating "this firmware *does*
                measure EFI

                binaries into PCR 7", or two, indicating "the TPM event log is

                unavailable and it's impossible to tell."


                Taking the wrong branch in this conditional led to an
                inappropriate

                policy being created to seal the LUKS passphrase, which could
                not be

                unlocked on the next boot, as in QEMU with edk2, EFI binaries
                *are*

                measured into PCR 7.

                Older balenaOS version (before v2.58) do not contain the logging
                helper

                in the rootfs and the new OS hooks fail to execute.


                This commit checks for the file existence before using it, and
                defines

                the logging functions when not detected.

                This change is required to migrate existing tests to run QEMU
                worker tests on GitHub Actions.

                GitHub hosted runners can't run the `ping` command:
                https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/1519 by design.

                If we still intend to use `ping`, the solution would be running
                QEMU worker tests on self-hosted runners which allow ICMP
                packets

                The takeover project currently relies on the ldd script being
                present in the hostOS pre-migration.


                While takeover can be adapted to use this script from a
                different location, it wouldn't hurt to have ldd in the hostOS
                from this point on.

                The main variables measured into PCR7 to ensure secure boot
                configuration integrity are the state and EFI vars, including PK, KEK,
                db, dbx, etc.

                However, some systems have firmware that will measure other, unexpected
                events, such as "DMA Protection Disabled" (related to a Windows feature
                [0]), or "Unknown event type" with strange data.

                These events can't be predicted, and other devices may have different
                measured events that aren't compliant with the TCG spec, so attempt to
                check the TPM event log and extend our digest with any unknown events
                that fit the bill.

                When migrating the TPM2 policy used to secure the LUKS
                passphrase to use

                different PCRs, we temporarily want to maintain fallback
                capability in

                case the newly installed hostapp doesn't pass healthchecks. This
                allows

                the system to boot back into the original OS and try again.


                In order to do so, we leave the passphrase in place with the old
                PCR

                authentication policy. The cryptsetup hook in the initramfs will
                try

                PCRs 0,2,3,7 and if those don't work we fallback to the original
                PCRs.


                Once the new system successfully boots, we'll re-encrypt the
                passphrase

                and use the new PCRs to create a policy to secure the key.

                When encrypting the LUKS passphrase, we need the ability to
                construct a

                policy that can logically OR together multiple policies, such as
                when

                the machine may or may not measure binaries loaded through EFI
                boot

                services into PCR7.


                We also need the ability to update the sealing policy to revoke

                previously valid configurations, such as after
                hostapp-healthcheck

                completes successfully. Ideally, this should be completed before

                modifying any efi variables, to prevent the system from becoming

                unbootable in the event of an interrupted update.


                These requirements necessitate the ability to create sealing
                policies

                and authenticate against them outside of the
                hw_{en,de}crypt_passphrase

                functions.


                This commit allows the caller to setup the sealing policy when

                encrypting, and choose what kind of authentication to use when

                decrypting.

                to represent data measured and hashed to extend TPM PCRs.


                This is useful to compute a PCR hash at runtime, which is
                normally

                computed by the firmware before the OS boots. This allows for
                adjusting

                a TPM2 policy to unlock the disk encryption passphrase with the
                updated

                state on the next boot.

                When a ESR release is deployed a tag with the base meta-balena
                version

                is created. This is used by the API to check for a valid OS
                version

                for updates.


                The current mechanism to find the base version only provides an
                ESR

                version for the first commit after the branch has been created.


                Using merge-base to find the common ancestor and `tag
                --points-at` to

                find the actual tag works for all commits after the branch is
                created.

                This behaviour was fine until a recent CI issue changed the
                types of tags used to version the repositories.


                This commit allows supporting of both types while the CI issue

              hash: 374c4c32df59cc00e0b04d0c619f6fb98a69f1a5
              body: >
                The dispatcher script that moves around FORWARD rules of shared

                interfaces currently calls iptables assuming it will always work

                but in practice two iptables commands can not run in parallel

                and we have occasionally seen the script fail with:


                Another app is currently holding the xtables lock.

                Perhaps you want to use the -w option?


                This patch adds the -w option to make the script wait for the
                lock

                when necessary.


                It also makes the script exit with an error code if anything
                fails,

                which will log the output as WARN instead of INFO as the errors

                are easy to overlook at this moment.

                We don't need any iptables features in order to perform

                hostapp-update in this build recipe, and it has no impact

                on build output.


                It does, however, improve compatbility with build environments
                and

                reduces the dependencies of the build host kernel.

                The supervisor will now write the following dtoverlay setting

                "gpio-key,gpio=4,active_low=0,gpio_pull=down"

                into config.txt in the following form:

                dtoverlay=gpio-key
                dtparam=gpio=4
                dtparam=active_low=0
                dtparam=gpio_pull=down

                So we need to rework the test to account for these changes.

                a203bcdfd567c0cc4b4ed9de493513142cd7463f introduced a dependency

                on /usr/sbin/balena-config-defaults to hostapp-update-hooks,
                however

                during HUP the script is not only executed in the "new" OS
                container

                but directly in the context of the "old" OS as well, so

                /usr/sbin/balena-config-defaults needs to exist there.

                The file was introduced in balenaOS v2.99.28, so trying to HUP

                from anything before that will fail.


                This patch changes this to a soft dependency so even if the file

                is missing HUP will continue.

                Yocto already splits the build sstate by target arch, native
                arch, toolchains, and machine where applicable.


                Keeping the caches separated by device type prevents sharing of
                common cache steps between identical toolchains and
                architectures.

              hash: e984b21b0270729784735d99f222294be65afd20
              body: >
                At this moment resin_update_state_probe looks for the root
                partition

                by UUID and assumes that only a single device is returned. This

                assumption breaks when the root is on a MD RAID1 device as not
                only

                the virtual MD device holds a filesystem with the given UUID,

                each member does as well.


                This patch makes resin_update_state_probe ignore devices

                that are RAID members which in that case will only return

                the MD device as expected.

                Currently devices with on-board storage fail to build in jenkins, if they don't provide a flasher image. One example is the CM4. Since there are multiple devices using this configuration, let's re-enable builds for all of them.

                        RPI firmware configuration allows repeating overlays to
                        define

                        configurations on multiple devices. For instance, for
                        configuring

                        multiple `ads` devices, `config.txt` needs to be setup
                        this way


                        ```

                        dtoverlay=ads1115,addr=0x48

                        dtoverlay=ads1115,addr=0x49

                        ```


                        Before this change, the supervisor would interpret both
                        lines as

                        belonging to the same overlay, preventing users from
                        configuring multiple

                        devices, and leading to a loop when trying to apply
                        configurations with

                        repeated overlays coming from the cloud side.

                        Rsync (v2) deltas have been broken since [Supervisor v14](https://github.com/balena-os/balena-supervisor/commit/460c3ba0aab31d18a02e3f5dda1838691768c494). While considered legacy,
                        they are still used by a few customers with devices running OS < 2.47.1.
                        This should fix v2 delta support for those devices until we can
                        completely remove rsync deltas from the supervisor

                      hash: e22253ce6ebc40e865b5bc26844901026f04ec4e

                        Previously, getBootConfig() of the config.txt backend
                        was omitting

                        array configurations such as gpio settings, thus
                        resulting in the SV

                        mistakenly assuming that boot config had not been
                        applied, since gpio

                        would not be in current config.txt config but would be
                        in target config.

                        This resulted in SV entering an infinite loop of
                        attempting to apply the

                        gpio config when it wasn't necessary.

                      hash: 6e6a796da5ecc846248eae4c8495bc626964c038

                        While ordering is important in the RPI firmware configuration file (config.txt),
                        some dt params are by default considered part of the base dt overlay
                        if they are not used by other overlays.
                        Unfortunately the [list of dtparams](https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/blob/master/boot/overlays/README#L133)
                        is too long to add all of them as exceptions, but we can add the params
                        used in the default config.txt provided in OS images, to avoid reboots
                        when updating to this new supervisor and correctly parsing the
                        provisioning config.txt as variables.

                        While this addition handles most common scenarios, there is still a
                        chance a user may have use other base overlay dt params in the initial
                        config, in which case those will be interpreted according to the
                        relative ordering

                        DT overlays and DT params need to be consumed in the
                        order that they

                        appear on the file. DT params apply to the last
                        dtoverlay defined on the

                        file, or to the base overlay.


                        This commit updates config.txt parsing to consider this
                        ordering, and it

                        also ensures global dtparams are written first so they
                        cannot be

                        overriden by later overlays.


                        Because of the more strict parsing method, it is
                        possible that existing

                        HOST_CONFIG vars do not match the interpretation of the
                        parser. If

                        that's the case, the supervisor will re-apply the target
                        state which

                        will cause the device to reboot.

                During HUP, rollback-health-breadcrumb and
                rollback-altboot-breadcrumb

                are created in the state partition to trigger rollback-health
                and

                rollback-altboot respectively on the next boot. After these
                services

                complete, they will remove these breadcrumbs.


                Make the broken init fallback tests wait for these services to
                become

                inactive before testing the state of the breadcrumbs. Otherwise,
                a race

                condition can make these tests fail. Most notably on slower
                systems,

                such as emulated generic-aarch64.

                for INTERNAL_DEVICE_KERNEL is not performed.


                Several devices that define internal storage but do not define

                INTERNAL_DEVICE_KERNEL will now fail and need to be fixed.

              body: >
                The balena bootloader initramfs contains the rootfs module and
                that

                will get the rootfs mounted but not checked first for errors.
                This is

                problematic because at first boot with network connectivity
                available,

                time will sync but the rootfs will still have the last mount
                time in

                1970. If at that point the rootfs gets corrupted then at next
                boot

                the rootfs' initramfs module from balena-bootloader will try to
                mount

                the rootfs without checking it first and then after that the
                filesystem

                check triggered by the fsck module from the actual kernel
                initramfs will

                fail like this:


                [init][INFO] Running filesystem checks on partition resin-rootA
                (/dev/disk/by-state/resin-rootA)

                resin-rootA contains a file system with errors, check forced.

                resin-rootA: Inodes that were part of a corrupted orphan linked
                list found.


                resin-rootA: UNEXPECTED INCONSISTENCY; RUN fsck MANUALLY.
                        (i.e., without -a or -p options)

                This commit will add the fsck module to balena bootloader's
                initramfs

                which will trigger filesystem checks before the rootfs module
                runs.

                This fixes rollback-health failures for boards like the Jetson
                Seeeed

                J4012, which updates efivars for capsule updates from container
                hooks

                and not from the current OS hooks.


                While the actual HUP works because of /sys being bindmounted by

                hostapp-update, rollbacks will fail to run the old OS hooks
                unless

                efivarfs is mounted.

                        Moby v25 adds the dynamically generated MAC address to
                        the Config field,

                        which breaks the state engine, preventing the state from
                        settling as the

                        current state never matches the target state (empty mac
                        address). This

                        seems to be a bug in Moby that we reported in
                        moby/moby#47228


                        The issue won't affect Balena devices until balenaEngine
                        is updated, and this

                        change fixes testing for now.

                        This would cause

                        the docker utils test to fail since the network/subnet

                The class will perform a basic configuration of a linux kernel

                to be used as the balena bootloader. Device types are expected

                to inherit it and perform additional device-specific
                configuration.

                The kexec initrd script currently removes the maxcpus=0 kernel
                arg

                which we use to put the system into non-SMP mode. This however
                does

                not work on all platforms and nr_cpus=1 seems to be a more
                robust

                solution, so with this patch nr_cpus will be removed as well.

                At this moment there is a race condition between NetworkManager

                and the engine when a shared interface is configured. If the
                interface

                is configured first and the engine second, the containers are
                allowed

                to access DHCP hosts behind the shared interface. If the engine
                comes

                up first and the shared interface second, access will be denied.


                This patch adds a dispatcher script that always configures the
                firewall

                rules as if the engine came up last. This does not really
                address

                the underlying issue but it overcomes the race condition and
                makes

                the behavior deterministic, which is good enough at this point.

                We've noticed that leaving the host discoverable indefinitely on
                Pi3 Autokit hosts solves sporadic scan failures. Thus, leaving
                the host discoverable for 20 minutes should be sufficient to
                prevent these cases.

                        This is meant to allow users to configure their device
                        to

                        resolve `.local` queries via dnsmasq by modifying
                        config.json, e.g. `dnsServers":

                        "/bob.local/172.17.0.33`.


                        This would fail before as MDNS lookups would always come
                        first

                      hash: 3ea8d4727a4f4b068b308d1f407b7cf0dae2733b
                      body: >
                        The `updateMetadata` step renames the container to match
                        the target

                        release when the service doesn't change between
                        releases. We have seen

                        this step fail because of an engine bug that seems to
                        relate to the

                        engine keeping stale references after container
                        restarts. The only way

                        around this issue is to remove the old container and
                        create it again.

                        This implements that workaround during the
                        updateMetadata step to deal

                        with that issue.

                There have been reports of an empty config vars cache file -
                probably

                because of a race condition when the reading of config.json
                happens just

                as the file is being replaced.


                Add some checks and retries to avoid this errors from happening.

                The log files are kept in the /run partition that also houses
                the udev database.

                By moving the /run partition to $ROOTFS_DIR/run in the migrate
                module, the udev database persists across reboots.

                The udevcleanup module was introduced to cleanup the database
                so it's regenerated on the final rootfs as the rules are
                different between initramfs and final rootfs. By moving /run
                before udevcleanup ran, the cleanup was not effective.

                This commit moves the relocation of the /run mount to the
                finish module, after udevcleanup is run, and groups it with
                the other relocations needed for the pivot switch.

                Looking at git history, the relocation of the /run partition
                was initially done in the rootfs module, so when the migrate
                module was introduced and needed to mount the rootfs, this
                relocation was just moved into the migration module itself,
                without considering later modules like finish.

                This provides an easy switch to enable tracing on HUP hooks that
                works

                both on old and new OS hooks as enabling it depends on a
                config.json

                setting.


                It is meant to debug field issues with HUP failure where all we
                see is:

                ```

                Before hooks (old os) ran successfully

                Failed to run the new hooks. Running current hooks..

                ```

                For example:

                Increasing the default to 10s should have no negative effect.

                Detecting whether the script is running in a PID namespace by
                checking

                `/proc/1/sched` does not work for newer kernels

                (see https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/17917).


                Properly detecting this is too cumbersome for a bash logging
                script,

                see https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/17902, however,
                falling

                back to the last check, that is, seeing if `/.dockerenv` exists
                is easy

                enough and works for our use case.


                This script will only be called from the hostOS, and the only
                case it is

                called from a container is during HUP and the container is
                always a hostOS

                image. So even though the interface chosen by moby, a file under
                /,

                is a bad interface in general, it works fine for the specific
                limitations

                of balenaOS.


                Also, check for `/run/.containerenv` which is the equivalent
                interface

                for podman for future proofing.

                        Whenever the Supervisor reports current state, it diffs
                        the current state

                        with its last reported current state. However, when the
                        Supervisor starts

                        up, there is no last reported state, since that last
                        report is stored in

                        process memory. Caching the last report in a location

                We add a script which can be replaced by device repositories
                to implement device-specific healthchecks. One usecase for this
                test is the Jetson UEFI firmware update check,
                but can be extended to all other devices as needed.

                We previously tried to use a single time limit for the execution
                of the

                healthcheck test on all device types. This was causing
                occasional false

                positives in our Continuous Integration pipeline, though --
                especially

                on slow devices like Pi Zeros and the generic-aarch64, which
                runs on

                emulated hardware.


                This commit addresses this issue, this commit:


                1. Limits execution for device types for which we have collected
                enough
                   data to have a good idea of how long the test should take.
                2. Uses time limits specific for each device type.

                        PR #2217 removed the expose configuration but also
                        caused a regresion

                        where ports set via the `ports` configuration would no
                        longer get

                        exposed to the host, despite portmappings being set.
                        This fixes that

                        issue by exposing only those ports comming from port
                        mappings.

                        The docker EXPOSE directive and corresponding
                        docker-compose `expose`

                        service configuration serves as documentation/metadata
                        that a container

                        listens on a certain port that may be used for service
                        discovery but it doesn't

                        have any real impact on the ability for

                        other containers on the same network to access the
                        exposed service via

                        the port. In newer engine implementations, this property
                        may conflict

                        with other network configurations, and prevent the
                        container from being

                        started by the docker engine (see #2211).


                        This PR removes code that would manage the expose
                        property and takes the

                        property out of the whitelist. A composition with the
                        `expose` property

                        will result in the log message `Ignoring unsupported or
                        unknown compose fields: expose`.


                        While this change should not have operational impact, it
                        still removes

                        a previously supported configuration and as such there
                        is a chance of it

                        being a breaking change for some applications. For this
                        reason it is

                        being published as a new major version.

                The code moved from meta-balena-kirkstone was not really
                specific to

                kirkstone so let's move it here so that future branches for
                newer yocto

                releases which we'll base off kirkstone don't continue to add
                this

                unneeded  duplication.

                There are other meta-balena-* directories that still contain the

                duplication we moved from meta-balena-kirkstone but we're not
                really

                concerned with that because going forward those old directories
                will

                naturally get deprecated.

                If the target supervisor image is already cached but there is no

                container running with it, the update script would just exit
                without

                actually running the target supervisor.


                This commit checks whether there is a running container using
                the

                target image and restarts the supervisor if there is none.

                don't want to mislead users with only full-disk encryption into
                thinking

                their system also has secure boot enabled when it doesn't.


                Disable the hook to unlock encrypted partitions if the firmware
                fails to

                boot into user mode.

                This flag isn't needed on balenaOS as the splash screen
                remains even after plymouthd is stopped.

                Having the flag in place prevents user apps from writing to
                tty consoles after stopping plymouth via dbus.

                        This reverts commit
                        0c7bad779291e15e419166a2c66c2a21dd06aa83, as that

                        change causes a service restart loop. The supervisor
                        cannot distinguish

                        between ports exposed via the `EXPOSE` directive and the
                        docker-compose

                        `expose` property. Because of this, in the case of
                        `network-mode:

                        service:<...>` the current state and target state never
                        match, leading

                        to a service restart loop.

                        The supervisor exposes ports configured using the
                        `EXPOSE` directive in

                        the dockerfile when configuring the container for
                        runtime. This can

                        cause issues if using `network_mode: service:<service
                        name>` as the

                        expose configuration is not compatible with that network
                        mode. This

                        fix now skips image exposed ports for that particular
                        network mode.

                When searching for devices matching the glob list in

                get_internal_device(), a glob match breaks from a nested loop
                rather

                than the parent loop, allowing the function to output multiple
                matches.


                When running the flasher, this results in the script failing
                with an

                incorrect path to the internal disk.


                Break from the parent loop to fix this behavior.

                This is done by the bootloader (uboot/grub) at this moment but
                as we

                are moving towards the balena 2nd stage bootloader, it needs to
                be

                moved into the initramfs.


                This adds a standalone recipe - by default yocto tries to build
                all

                modules defined in the initramfs-framework recipe, which breaks

                on armv7 when abroot is defined there. This is because it
                depends

                on grub-editenv which is not supported on armv7.

                The rootfs script uses both os-helpers-fs and os-helpers-logging

                though the package depends on neither. This seems to work now
                because

                in most cases something else pulls in the dependencies or the
                code

                on a particular device does not fall under the branches that use

                the missing functions.

                api triggered updates.

                314047e and b5c5214 made flasher block until the
                resin-device-register

                service exits and made resin-device-register give up after 6
                seconds

                not to block infinitely when no network is available. This
                effectively

                means that if the device fails to register within first 6
                seconds,

                it will never retry, flasher will not report status to the
                dashboard

                and the device will only register on first boot.


                This patch changes the logic back to resin-device-register
                trying

                in the background in an infinite loop and moves the "give the
                device

                a chance to register" delay to flasher itself. It also extends

                the wait to openvpn as flasher already does that and wants VPN
                to run

                to be debuggable - in case flashing fails, it would be possible

                to SSH in via the VPN and look at the logs remotely.

                The kernel-balena class contains:

                CONIFG_SECURITY=n


                which is mispelled and not being applied. The commit where this
                was

                introduced claims it's needed to completely disable the audit
                logs, and

                also that the security framework is unused.


                I disagree in that it's unused - the hostOS is not using any
                security

                framework, but applications may, so luckily the security
                framework was

                never disabled.


                Removing this mispelled entry should have no functional effect.

                the audit subsystem is disabled will depend on the final kernel

                configuration. Definitely we have not seen a need to disable it
                recently,

                and we have not seen the kernel log flooded with messages.


                I'd argue the disabling of the audit subsystem in meta-balena
                serves no

                need but I also have no specific reason to remove it at the
                moment.

                At this moment grub.cfg sources /grub/grub_extraenv which works
                fine

                on MBR systems, however on EFI systems this does not work
                because GRUB

                is installed in /EFI/BOOT/ rather than /grub/.


                This patch replaces the hardcoded /grub with ${prefix} which
                should

                expand to the appropriate directory regardless of the platform.
                It also

                removes the loading of grub_extraenv from the secure boot
                variant

                of the GRUB config since this would not load without a signature
                anyway.

                The imx8mm-var-dart-plt also uses a custom implementation
                for detecting the boot switch, so let's make use of the
                existing support in meta-balena for the testbot provisioning
                use-case and add this DT in the Autokit.

                GitHub App installation tokens are short-lived and do not
                need to be rotated the same way PATs do.

                The default app ID and installation ID correspond to
                flowzone-bot[app] installed in the balena-os Org.

                which panics the kernel and triggers a reboot loop

                from a "device has been tampered with" state on regular builds

                with no console output.

                systems with secure boot and full-disk encryption.


                If kexec fails, we don't want to continue with the rest of the
                boot

                process in the first stage kernel, so bail out on failure.

                The 6.1 kernel has a number of Kbuild and architecture changes
                that required us to update our devsrc recipe. With these changes
                we are once again able to build on target modules for all
                supported archectures.

                        It's not an official status from container inspects, and
                        the Supervisor

                        doesn't set it internally anywhere. It's better to
                        remove it entirely as the

                        method by which Supervisor sets internal service
                        statuses is by using a global

                        event emitter (reportNewStatus) which makes things
                        difficult to test.

                We have seen devices that won't change PCR1 hash when a
                temporary boot

                order override was applied or secure boot was disabled via BIOS
                setup.

                The implementation of what PCR1 actually measures is very

                device-specific, but many of the risks can be mitigated by
                setting up

                a BIOS password and disabling F-key shortcuts for interacting
                with

                the firmware.

                Both `kernel-modules-headers` and `kernel-devsrc` provide kernel
                headers

                since Yocto Thud switched `kernel-devsrc` from full source to
                just

                kernel headers.


                The only difference between them is that
                `kernel-modules-headers` builds

                some target binaries which need to be built with `make
                modules_prepare`

                when using `kernel-devsrc` headers. These binaries depend on
                libc version

                matching though so they have shown to be problematic.


                This commit removes the `kernel-modules-headers` recipe and
                modifies

                `kernel-devsrc` to replace it. The deployed artifact remains
                named as

                `kernel-modules-headers` as it's a more descriptive name.


                This introduces a breaking change in the balenaOS API as
                customers that

                are using `kernel-modules-headers` to build external kernel
                modules will

                now need to issue a `make modules_prepare` as part of their
                build scripts.


                Fixes #1822

                After switching to LUKS2, the header size increased from 2MB to
                16MB.

                While HUP of older systems works, it is impossible to provision

                new encrypted systems.


                This patch fixes the header size in flasher.

                      body: >
                        The previous implementation in #2170 of parsing the
                        container status was too general,

                        because it relied on the mistaken assumption that a
                        container would have a status of

                        `Stopped` if it was manually stopped. This turned out to
                        be untrue, as manually stopped

                        containers were also getting restarted by the Supervisor
                        due to their inspect status of

                        `exited`. With this, parsing the exit message became
                        unavoidable as there are no other

                        clear ways to discern a container that has been manually
                        stopped and shouldn't be started

                        from a container experiencing the Engine-host race
                        condition issue (again, see #2170).


                        Since we're just parsing the exit error message, we
                        don't need to worry about different behaviors

                        amongst restart policies, as any container with the
                        error message on exit should be started.

                        Previously, `concatReadSeekCloser.Read()` would
                        incorrectly return

                        an `io.ErrUnexpectedEOF` if the last read from the
                        second concatenated

                        `Reader` didn't completely fill the passed buffer.


                        For instance:


                        ```
                              First Reader    Second Reader
                            |aaaaaaaaaaaaa|bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb|      <--- concatReadSeekCloser
                            |--- previously read ---|--- buffer ---| <--- last read
                                                              |xxxx| <--- "excess" buffer
                        ```


                        In this example, we have a `concatReadSeekCloser` that
                        concatenates two

                        `Reader`s (`aaa...` and `bbb...`). The last `Read()`
                        used a buffer

                        larger than the yet-to-be-read portion of the `bbb...`.
                        So, it would

                        incorrectly return an `io.ErrUnexpectedEOF`.


                        This commit makes sure that last `Read()` returns all
                        the remaining data

                        without an error. It also adds various test cases for

                        `concatReadSeekCloser.Read()`, many of which would fail
                        before this

                        correction.


                        Interestingly, this bug was silently affecting us. Not
                        in a fatal way,

                        but causing deltas to be larger than necessary. Indeed,
                        running

                        `TestDeltaSize` after this commit shows that some test
                        cases are

                        producing deltas smaller than what we expected before.
                        For posterity,

                        see all the details below.


                        We use `concatReadSeekCloser`s to concatenate all layers
                        of the basis

                        image when creating the "signature" of the basis image.
                        In this process,

                        the `concatReadSeekCloser`s are wrapped around by a
                        buffered reader with

                        a buffer of 65kB.


                        If, in any read, part of this 65kB buffer was beyond the
                        second

                        concatenated reader, it would result in an
                        `io.ErrUnexpectedEOF`. This

                        would not cause the whole process to fail, but would
                        prematurely end the

                        signature generation: some of the final blocks in the
                        basis image would

                        not be added to the signature. Therefore, if those
                        blocks appeared in

                        the target image, they'd result in (larger) LITERAL,
                        instead of

                        (smaller) COPY operations.


                        For illustration, here's the delta generated for the
                        `delta-006-008`

                        test case. First before this commit:

                        This is necessary since the builder no longer passes the
                        platform flag

                        to the build. This would lead to dockerfiles that are
                        mixing multi and single

                        arch stages to pull the wrong architecture images,
                        particularly when

                        trying to build images in emulated builds (e.g. armv7hf
                        built on aarch64).


                        Moving the full build to multi-arch solves this as the
                        docker engine is

                        capable of chosing the right architecture from the
                        manifest.

                This should be the default but with no explicit argument we
                still

                end up with LUKS1 partitions. This patch adds the parameter to
                enforce

                LUKS2 formatting and adds conversion to LUKS2 to the cryptsetup

                initrd script.

                This helper command saves and compares crc32 sum for a memory

                        restart policy
                      hash: 7f3214195838a8bf3242ef7540b4487338687e4c
                      body: >
                        There exists a race condition between Engine and a host
                        resource that may not

                        be immediately created. In this race condition, if a
                        container's compose config

                        depends on the existence of that host resource, such as
                        a network interface, and the

                        Engine tries to create & start the container before the
                        host resource is created, the

                        Engine will not reattempt to start the container,
                        regardless of the restart policy.

                        This is undesireable behavior but seems to be the
                        behavior as implemented by Docker.


                        To rectify this, the Supervisor state funnel noops for a
                        grace period of 1 minute

                        after starting a container to see that the container's
                        status has become 'running`.

                        If the container exits because of the race condition,
                        the status becomes 'exited' and the

                        Supervisor will attempt to generate another start step.
                        This noop-wait-start step loop

                        will repeat until the container is able to start.


                        If the container is never able to start, there was a
                        problem in the host in the creation of the

                        host resource, and that should be fixed at the host
                        level.


                        This commit does not handle the case of services with
                        restart policies "no" or "on-failure"

                        which encounter this host race, as metadata from
                        container inspects needs to be introduced

                        during step calculation in order to figure out whether
                        services with those restart policies

                        need to be started. This will be fixed in a future PR.

      body: >
        Backporting to ESR branches hits a flowzone error as both pull_request

        and pull_request_target run and this only works for master.


        Removing the pull_request_target run for ESR branches fixes this, but

        also removes the possibility of external pull requests into ESR
        branches,

        which we don't actually need.

                getting a

                `command not found` when an API endpoint is defined.

                The purpose of testing the API calls is to detect breaking
                changes, not

                to fail builds because of temporary network or API access
                problems.


                Printing a warning instead should be enough for developers to
                detect

                breaking changes.

                When programming keys for secure boot, some devices do not clear

                the setup mode flag after a new PK is installed. In this case

                flasher will reboot in order to ensure the keys are actually
                saved

                and the device comes back with secure boot enabled. Since we
                changed

                flasher to be unsigned by default, this reboot causes a security

                violation.


                With this patch flasher will add a new boot entry before issuing

                the reboot so that signed flasher comes up and the installation
                process

                can continue.

                Currently the db.auth file is signed as "append" in order to
                make HUP work.

                Most UEFI firmwares will accept such file even for "replace",
                which we do

                during the initial provisioning, however we have seen devices
                that will

                only allow appending, which makes flasher fail.


                With this patch flasher will use the esl file for initial
                programming

                of the db variable.


                PK and KEK are unaffected.

                        Previously, we'd time-out a pull operation after
                        unsuccessfully retrying

                        for about 17 minutes (for details see commit

                        582487f832c59c2f734a780ab0492833f29002c9). This worked
                        fine in most

                        situations, but we have seen at least one case of a
                        particularly

                        unreliable network connection that would not be able to
                        finish a large

                        pull when operating under this policy.


                        This commit:


                        * Completely removes timeouts from image pulls. We'll
                        keep retrying
                          forever, or until users cancel the pull. (From the perspective of the
                          REST API, "canceling" mean closing the HTTP connection. This is what
                          happens when a user Ctrl+C during a pull in the CLI, or, say, we kill
                          a curl process that was using the REST API to pull image.)
                        * Still uses exponential back-off, but we now limit the
                        interval between
                          retries to 5 minutes. The rationale is that some very unreliable
                          networks may be up only for relatively small time windows. Therefore,
                          using intervals that are too long would increase the risk of missing
                          these windows.
                        * Tries to avoid flooding the log stream with messages
                        about retries.
                          We'll log every retry attempt up to the 10th. After that, we'll log
                          retries only once about every 2h. This retry count is reset every time
                          we successfully download any amount of data.

                Let's switch it back to unsupported.

                        the flasher image to force an installer migration.


                        With the current QEMU setting, `installerForceMigration`
                        alone is not

                        enough and the QEMU_INTERNAL_STORAGE also needs to be
                        set to false in

                        the worker's environment so only a single external disk
                        is attached to

                        the emulator.

                        After a recent change enforcing all the partitions to be
                        on the same

                        block device, encrypted partitions are no longer being
                        detected

                        correctly. This is because the assumption that the
                        parent block device

                        is a substring of the actually mounted block device does
                        not work

                        for LUKS devices - the mount will either be
                        /dev/mapper/luks-XXX

                        or /dev/dm-X while the parent device is still e.g.
                        /dev/sda.


                        The usual balenaOS boot partition is also split in two -
                        boot and efi.

                        The boot partition (mounted under /mnt/boot) is
                        encrypted and the efi

                        partition (mounted under /mnt/efi) is not.


                        This patch generalizes the detection of the parent
                        device so that

                        it works with both encrypted and unencrypted partitions.

                        The docker compose V2 spec no longer accepts
                        `network_mode: bridge`,

                        which means we can no longer override the network
                        configuration of

                        the `balena-supervisor` service for tests.


                        For this reason we now create a separate service to run
                        the built

                        supervisor `balena-supervisor-sut` and run API tests
                        against this

                        service instead of the default `balena-supervisor`.

                At this moment if the cryptsetup initrd script executes before
                the root

                device comes up (e.g. when booting off a USB disk), it assumes

                that encryption is not in place because it was not able to find

                the EFI partition.


                This patch adds a wait4file loop to the script that waits

                for the /dev/disk/by-state directory. This is not tied to any
                particular

                partition or device but since the directory does not exist by
                default

                and is only created by a custom balenaOS udev rule, its
                existence

                implies that the rule fired and a device with balenaOS
                partitions

                is present in the system.

                        A bug in service comparison would make it that a device
                        already running

                        a service from a new release with network changes would
                        never stop the

                        running service so remaining services would forever get
                        stuck in

                        `Downloaded` state.


                        This fixes the comparison so the service will get killed
                        in this case,

                        particularly allowing devices to recover from #1576

                        services in the `Downloaded` state, because the state

                        Previous behavior would make it that an `updateMetadata`

                        network and a container change.

                A safe copy would only work for files that are read by fatrw
                also and that is

                not the case for boot files. Still, some file like `config.json`
                would

                benefit from a safe copy so we still try that first.


                Fixes #2998

                If a safe copy is preferred but non-critical, the unsafe fatrw
                command

                can be used and if fatrw does not have enough resources to make
                a safe

                copy it will fallback to a standard cp.


                This is useful when performing hostOS updates for example where
                a safe

                copy would only work for files that are read by fatrw also and
                that is

                not the case for boot files for example.

                        internal state

                        gets inconsistent in case of crashes.

                        The actions now work by passing an intermediate state to
                        the state

                        engine.


                        - doPurge first removes the user app from the target
                        state and passes
                          that to the state engine for purging. Since intermediate state doesn't
                          remove images, this will have the effect of basically re-installing
                          the app.

                        - doRestart modifies the target state by first removing
                        only the
                          services from the current state but keeping volumes and networks. This
                          has the same effect as before where services were stopped one by one

                        There were multiple places in the state engine that
                        skipped some

                        operations while in local mode. In reality, all it's
                        needed while in

                        local mode is to skip image and volume deletion.


                        This commit simplifies application-manager and compose
                        app to be more

                        local mode agnostic and instead making the image
                        deletion and volume

                        deletion configurable via function arguments.


                        This also has the benefit to make the treatment of local
                        mode

                        applications more similar to cloud mode applications,
                        allowing for

                        API endpoints to function the same way both modes.

                When parsing additional variables to be passed to the bitbake
                build,

                keys and values are split using equals as a delimiter. However,
                the

                splitting process does not split only on the first occurrence,
                which

                results in removing equals signs from the value as well. This is

                problematic with base64 encoded strings, which are padded with
                equals

                signs.


                Split only on the first occurrence, leaving the value intact.

                After moving to hashes for authenticating the allowed OS list,
                we need

                to update the db variable on each HUP to make sure the new OS

                will be bootable. After confirming that the update went through,

                we need to update the dbx variable to make sure the old OS is

                no longer bootable.

                In order to use hashes we can not use UEFI time-based
                authentication

                for updates as this would prevent rollbacks. Instead we ship
                appendable

                updates for both db and dbx that HUP can use.

              hash: c205b247c14cbdd132cb1bb335da2d17fa40caf5
              body: >
                This patch changes the validation of bootable images from
                certificate

                signatures to a list of allowed hashes of binaries. This only
                applies

                on db level, PK and KEK are still certificates.


                The motivation is that certificates expire and we need to be
                sure

                that even devices that have been lying on a shelf for several
                years

                or whose CMOS battery has died and reset date to 1970-01-01 are
                still

                bootable. Using hashes is more aligned with this use-case and
                also

                more similar to the approach that embedded SoCs use.

              hash: 1eb49acca051d7c34fa0e48bd673fc764320b2e9
              body: >
                Shipping a single image with signature checks enabled will
                enforce

                the signatures on non-secure-boot systems as well. GRUB does not
                have

                a simple method to check whether secure boot is enabled that
                could

                be embedded with the default built-in config.


                With this patch we build two separate images - one enforcing

                the signatures and the other one not, keeping the original
                behavior.

                HUP and flasher both can detect if secure boot is enabled so
                they

                put the correct image in place when installing/updating GRUB.

                        Node 15 [changed the way it treats unhandled promise rejections](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/doc/changelogs/CHANGELOG_V15.md#throw-on-unhandled-rejections---33021) from a warning to a throw.
                        For this reason errors like a corrupt migration directory, that happens when trying to
                        roll back to a previous supervisor version were no longer showing a
                        message but dumping the full minimized code into the journal logs.

                        This PR adds a catchall on app.ts to log the exception and throw an exit
                        code of 1.

                    - subject: Mount boot partition into container on Supervisor start
                      hash: 49ee1042a87ce0b101054e32b84afaa324a371de
                      body: >
                        As the Supervisor is a privileged container, it has
                        access to host /dev, and therefore has access

                        to boot, data, and state balenaOS partitions. This
                        commit sets up the framework for the following:


                        - Finds the /dev partition that corresponds to each
                        partition based on partition label

                        - Mounts the partitions into set mountpoints in the
                        device

                        - Removes reliance on env vars and mountpoints provided
                        by host's start-balena-supervisor script

                        - Simplifies host path querying by centralizing these
                        queries through methods in lib/host-utils.ts


                        This particular changes env vars for and mounts the boot
                        partition.


                        Since the Supervisor would no longer rely on container
                        `run` arguments provided by a host script,

                        this change moves Supervisor closer to being able to
                        start itself (Supervisor-as-an-app).

                        Notable improvements these new versions bring:


                        * Optimized code path for generating deltas with blocks
                        that are
                          power-of-two-sized.
                        * Avoid allocating unbounded amounts of memory when the
                        target differs
                          completely from the source.
                        * Several bugfixes in edge cases that shall not affect
                        balenaEngine.

                        If the same state directory/files are used for multiple
                        installations,

                        the available space can be filled, and the installer
                        will fail with the

                        error "insufficient space for NV allocation".


                        Move swtpm state to tmpfs to create new state files
                        every run.

              body: >
                Setting `LimitCORE=0` will avoid the creation of core dump files
                on

                containers. This will avoid cases in which a crashlooping user
                app ends

                up filling up the entire storage with dump files.


                Users can re-enable core dumps in their services by manually
                setting the

                `ulimits.core`. For example:


                ```

                services:
                  my-service:
                    ulimits:
                      core: -1
                ```


                (Where -1 is used to mean "unlimited")

                Setting `Delegate=yes` ensures that systemd will not change anything on
                the cgroups created for running the containers.

                This setting is used upstream since this commit:

                    - subject: Simplify and improve delta error handling
                      hash: 2c972dff108a153896116b07798bbc959c07ef01

                        The original delta code on the `xfer` package used to
                        set `d.err` when

                        an unexpected EOF was found in the delta tar stream.
                        Turns out `d.err`

                        would end up being overwritten before it was read, so
                        that initial

                        assignment was effectively a no-op.


                        This commit simplifies the code a little bit by removing
                        this bogus

                        assignment and also improves the error reporting a notch
                        by adding more

                        context to the error messages.

                        was a good deal of duplication.


                        This piece of code is tricky to factor out into a
                        separate function.

                        Basically we had two options:


                        1. Create a completely reusable, DRY function that
                        encapsulates all the
                           duplicate code. Sounds nice until you noticed that would be a
                           horrendous function with 5 return values and overly obscure
                           semantics.
                        2. We create a small set of functions with clearer
                        interfaces and
                           semantics, but which will still lead to some code duplication between
                           the `pull` and `load` implementations.

                        I opted for the second alternative because the resulting
                        code is much

                        easier to understand and maintain. Also, the remaining
                        duplication is

                        mostly dumb, integration and error handling code that
                        almost writes

                        itself as we call the new reusable functions -- so, this
                        is sort of a

                        benign duplication.

                        This is necessary since the builder no longer passes the
                        platform flag

                        to the build. This would lead to dockerfiles that are
                        mixing multi and single

                        arch stages to pull the wrong architecture images,
                        particularly when

                        trying to build images in emulated builds (e.g. armv7hf
                        built on aarch64).


                        Moving the full build to multi-arch solves this as the
                        docker engine is

                        capable of chosing the right architecture from the
                        manifest.

                        There were various usages of Bash-specific features. As
                        a result, the

                        script would work correctly only on OSes that have `sh`
                        as an alias to

                        `bash`. It would fail on Ubuntu, for example.

                        A couple of changes here:


                        * Check for sudo necessity and availability before doing
                        any real work.
                          Better to warn and exit quick and early!
                        * Remove the support for using `su`. It was broken for
                        two reasons.
                          First, unlike `sudo`, `su -c` expects the command as a single
                          argument. Second, `su`, unlike `sudo`, reads the password from stdin
                          which in this case "contains" the tarball being downloaded. The second
                          point is particularly tricky to solve without saving the tarball to
                          storage (and we want to avoid extra storage space and wear). And,
                          anyway, users that can `su -c` can also `su` manually before
                          installing.

                        * Check for missing dependencies before doing any real
                        work. Better to
                          warn and exit quick and early!
                        * Fix the actual check. We previously used `[ $abort ]
                        && exit 1` which
                          caused the script to always exit (`abort` is never empty).

                The patch applied to systemd addressed this upstream moby issue:
                https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/27202

                This was fixed in containerd 1.0.2:
                https://github.com/containerd/console/pull/10/commits/c358734ec94e72903243bd1c9034874a1de09424

                This fix is present in balena engine since v17.13.5, which has been in
                use since commit 53ce147. Drop this patch from meta-balena-dunfell and
                later.

                        Some incoming tests require QEMU to exit, simulating a
                        device powering

                        off, before starting QEMU again. This is used to
                        "reflash" a virtualized

                        device before continuing with testing, for instance
                        after tampering with

                        boot files on a secure boot enabled device to verify
                        secure boot checks.


                        However, swtpm will exit when QEMU disconnects. The
                        `--exit-code-from`

                        compose argument implies `--abort-on-container-exit`, so
                        this results

                        in the test run aborting prematurely.


                        Adapt the entrypoint and command of the swtpm container
                        to always

                        restart the program without exiting the container.

                This avoids device repositories having to specify it, and it can always
                be overwritten in append files.

                Because we use this patch with various u-boot versions it often
                happens that this patch

                does not apply so we then need to rework it in the device
                integration layer. Instead it

                would be better to have some code at configure time parsing the
                same file and inserting

                the balena env dynamically, so regardless of u-boot versions we
                use.

                        Preloaded devices can require that the device is pinned
                        to the preloaded

                        release on provisioning. However if the provisioned
                        release gets

                        released in the future, that would lead to the device
                        remaining in "VPN

                        only" state forever as the provisioning process could
                        not finish due to

                        pinning failure.


                        This commit changes the behavior so if the release does
                        not exist, the

                        pinning step is skipped and the device follows the fleet
                        pinning state.

                        This is necessary since the builder no longer passes the
                        platform flag

                        to the build. This would lead to dockerfiles that are
                        mixing multi and single

                        arch stages to pull the wrong architecture images,
                        particularly when

                        trying to build images in emulated builds (e.g. armv7hf
                        built on aarch64).


                        Moving the full build to single-arch solves this as the
                        docker engine is

                        capable of chosing the right architecture from the
                        manifest. Once some

                        of the builder issues are fixed, we should move to #2141

                        The issue with the original Supervisor implementation of
                        the firewall is that

                        on Supervisor start, the Supervisor flushes the INPUT
                        chain of the filter table.

                        This doesn't play well with services that add to the
                        INPUT chain on startup that

                        may start up before the Supervisor, such as certain
                        NetworkManager connection

                        profiles. This change only replaces the BALENA-FIREWALL
                        rule in the INPUT chain,

                        preserving the other rules as well as their order.

              body: >
                In the Internet connection sharing test one of the checks may
                run

                into a racing problem. The following command is holding the
                iptables

                lock for 3 seconds while NetworkManager activates a connection
                with

                sharing enabled:


                `flock /run/xtables.lock sleep 3 & nmcli c up dummy & wait`


                NetworkManager waits for 2 seconds for the lock to be released
                and

                those three seconds should be enough for one of the iptables
                rules

                to fail. However there is no guarantee that NetworkManager will
                start

                adding the iptables rules that quickly - it may start adding
                those

                after one out of those three seconds already passed, which will

                lead to all iptables rules to be set at the end.


                This check is non-essential for the test itself, so it is
                removed with

                this commit.

                Previously, we bailed out of the installer when the system was
                in user

                mode (keys enrolled) but the user had not opted in to secure
                boot, as it

                was ambiguous whether the user actually wanted SB/FDE.


                However, some systems come with vendor keys pre-enrolled, and a
                user may

                simply turn off secure boot in the firmware setup menu without
                erasing

                the keys. This would result in the installer bailing out even
                though

                secure boot is disabled in the firmware menu.


                Check that secure boot is enabled in addition to having keys
                enrolled

                before bailing out.

                Test for the NetworkManager patch done in

                https://github.com/balena-os/meta-balena/pull/2963


                A racing condition between balenaEngine and NetworkManager led
                to some Internet

                connection sharing iptables rules not being applied when NM
                connection profile

                with Internet sharing was activated at boot.


                This test checks whether all necessary iptables rules are added
                by artificially

                blocking iptables for 1 second and then for 3 seconds while a
                connection

                profile with Internet sharing is activated.

                There is a race condition between it and grub_conf:do_deploy,

                we have seen builds fail when grub_conf:do_deploy does not

                We have added DER certificates because it is the only format

                that QEMU/TianoCore accepts in UEFI setup. Since we made setup
                mode

                work properly, there is no need to program the QEMU keys
                manually

                and therefore there is no reason to pollute the boot partition
                with

                the DER files. If indeed necessary, they can always be extracted

                from the ESL, which is still shipped. Shipping the DER files is
                also

                not possible when db uses hashes instead of certificates, which
                we

                want to move towards.

                Previously, it was being referred to only as "balena". Being
                explicit

                that this is about balenaEngine makes it simpler to grep for

                Engine-related portions of balenaOS. Might also help a tad bit
                when

                looking at logs.

                When migrating, we can't assume a device can be remotely powered

                finish the flashing with a reboot instead of a shutdown.


                This is possible as the initramfs does not currently have a
                shutdown

                command and avoids the complexity of having to detect whether we
                are

                running from initramfs or not.

                When `recovery` is passed in the kernel command line, the
                initramfs will

                not boot into the OS but launch adbd.


                A connection can then be established via the network (if a DHCP
                address

                is provided) or using a USB gadget connection.


                For a network connection, the client needs to install `adb` and
                run:

                ```

                adb connect $IPADDR:5555

                adb shell

                ```


                Other adb commands, like pull/push of files are also available.

        This DT can boot the flasher image only with a balena
        u-boot. Since balena u-boot knows how to load the image
        from the rootfs, the kernel can be removed from the
        boot partition, because the total size of the contents
        there now exceed half of the filesystem size.

        According to github action syntax [1], there is no special character

        characters with a `*`.

                There is nothing in `balena-config-vars` itself that needs

                change it so scripts don't exit if it is not available. For
                example,

                `balena-config-vars` gets used in the initramfs but `fatrw` is
                not

                required (and it is quite heavy).

                to define if RAID support is required.

                These dependencies are already part of the corresponding
                packagegroups,

                so listing them here is redundant and wrong as it increases the

                the initramfs with no reason.

                existance before using

                it.

                The by-label links can be used both for physical and mapper
                devices (used

                in disk encryption).


                Adding a loop that waits for the links to be available adds
                robustness

                in case there are device specific delays.

                balenaOS uboot exports specific environment variables

                in resinOS_uEnv.txt and does not have any use-cases of

                saving the entire uboot environment in any device specific

                partitions. This because it relies on the default environment
                being

                stored in the u-boot binary.


                Let's disable the saveenv command and avoid potential incorrect

                usage which may overwrite the partition table, resin-boot
                filesystem

                or other areas of the eMMC that may be pre-configured by the
                BSP.

                - The Jetson TX2 NX has an eMMC and no SD-CARD slot

                - The JN30B Nano uses the eMMC module and not the SD-CARD one

                - The Radxa CM3 on RPI CM4 IOBoard as well as the Radxa zero use
                  rockchip software tools in order to put the eMMC in mass-storage mode
                - The CM4 module comes in two flavors: one with eMMC and the
                Lite version
                  which uses the carrier board sd-card slot to load the image. Both use the
                  same balenaOS image.
                  I switched the storage to internal for this DT because it *may* have
                  one, but this solely depends on the actual module.
                  Another consideration is that this DT can also boot from a USB stick
                  or a NVME drive connected to the mPCIE port.

                        When we don't have a valid way to handle an exception,
                        just throw it.

                        The traceback is more useful than the handler.

                The engine is currently versioned in such a way that upstream
                semver tags are added to branches before merging to master.

                We don't want to try and pin to those commits so only
                consider automated GitHub Releases.

                        We have seen a few times devices with duplicated network
                        names for some

                        reason. While we don't know the cause the networks get
                        duplicates, this

                        can be disruptive for updates as trying to create a
                        container referencing a duplicate

                        network results in a 400 error from the engine.


                        This commit finds and removes duplicate networks via the
                        state engine,

                        this means that even if somehow a container could be
                        referencing a

                        network that has been duplicated later somehow, this
                        will remove the

                        container first.


                        While thies doesn't solve the problem of duplicate
                        networks being

                        created in the first place, it will fix the state of the
                        system to

                        correct the inconsistency.

                        We have seen a few times devices with duplicated network names for some
                        reason. While we don't know the cause the networks get duplicates,
                        this is disruptive of updates, as the supervisor usually queries
                        resource by name, resulting in a 400 error from the engine because of
                        the ambiguity.

                        This replaces those queries by name to queries by id. This includes
                        network removal. If a `removeNetwork` step is generated, the supervisor
                        opts to remove all instances of the network with the same name as it
                        cannot easily resolve the ambiguity.

                        This doesn't solve the problem of ambiguous networks, because even if
                        networks are referenced by id when creating a container, the engine will
                        throw an error (see https://github.com/balena-os/balena-supervisor/issues/590#issuecomment-1423557871)

                not

                executed. When sourced, the shebang should be ignored.


                However, we have seen instances where a bash script sourcing a
                sh

                os-helper scripts triggers POSIX behaviour, specifically glob
                parsing

                failures.

                When a user runs the flasher with secure boot enabled in
                `config.json`,

                the public keys used to validate the bootloader are enrolled. If
                any

                other bootloader signature fails to validate against this public
                key, it

                won't be executed.


                If the user attempts to run the balenaOS flasher on that system
                again

                without first enabling the secure boot option, the flasher won't
                enroll

                keys, but the installed system will be signed. This will result
                in a

                secure boot enabled system without full-disk encryption.


                Bail out in this case so the user must choose to explicitly
                opt-in to

                secure boot for the new installation, and full-disk encryption
                along

                with it. Otherwise, the user must reset the enrolled keys to
                install

                without secure boot.

                skipping

                key enrollment when secure boot is enabled. Compare using an

                When refactoring secure boot setup, a logic mistake in the
                purpose and

                use of SECUREBOOT_VAR meant that devices booting the flasher
                with keys already

                enrolled would bail out with an incorrect message about secure
                boot not

                being supported in firmware.


                This variable is `00` on systems with secure boot support in
                firmware,

                but not enabled and enforced, `01` on systems where secure boot
                is

                enforced, and empty when secure boot is unsupported.


                Change this conditional to bail out only when the variable is
                empty,

                indicating that secure boot is unsupported.

                        Not all platforms support secure boot, notably aarch64
                        using tianocore

                        firmware. Additionally, swtpm may not be available for
                        all platforms.

                        Accordingly, move the swtpm service to a separate
                        compose file that is

                        only used when secure boot is enabled.

                        QEMU is capable of using an emulated software TPM

                        provide this to the QEMU worker.

                get_dev_path_from_label() calls lsblk to get the name and label
                of a

                disk, then filters the list using the label and returns a /dev
                path.


                The name returned when using a luks encrypted partition is the

                /dev/mapper name, rather than the kernel's device mapper name
                under

                /dev/dm-*. When assembling a path under /dev using the luks
                name, the

                path is invalid, and the by-state links aren't created.


                This leads to the rootfs hook failing to find and mount the
                resin-rootA

                partition.


                Change the attribute retrieved using lsblk to kname to fix this.

                Instead, skip the key enrollment if the image is not signed,
                resulting

                in a non secure-boot installation.

                This allows for the testbot to set resin_flasher_skip=0
                in the extra_uEnv.txt file of the flasher image and
                bypass the boot switch detection mechanisms used for
                specific private device types.

                The boot pins would otherwise prevent the flasher
                from running if they were set to the eMMC position.

                The flasher extra_uEnv.txt file overrides any resin_flasher_skip
                value previously configured by the device integration layer.

                The previous method of disabling NTP by stopping the nameserver

                (dnsmasq) relied on the dnsmasq unit not being reactivated
                before the

                test completed.


                Instead, disable NTP by blocking ntp.org in the local dnsmasq
                instance

                using a dbus method call. NTP is re-enabled as before, by
                restarting

                dnsmasq.

              hash: 345d1440d34fe042f03884c4ae32f0ba7e7768e8
              body: |
                In rare cases (believed to be caused by a non-atomic file creation and
                writing operation in containerd), we end up with an empty file at
                `/mnt/data/docker/containerd/daemon/io.containerd.grpc.v1.introspection/uuid`.
                This causes `ctr version` (and hence the health check) to fail. See
                https://github.com/balena-os/balena-engine/issues/322

                This commit addresses this issue in two ways:

                1. Before running `ctr version`, we check if the uuid file exists and is
                   empty. If so, we remove it. (The subsequent execution of `ctr
                   version` by the healthcheck will create the file again.)
                2. After running `ctr version`, we check if the uuid file was really
                   created and is not empty.

                In both cases, when an empty uuid file is detected, we log the event to
                help us confirm our hypothesis about the root cause.

                If the signing server's response is anything other than
                successful, such

                as with an authentication failure or bad request, the HTTP
                status code

                and response are hidden due to the --silent flag passed to cURL.


                Drop the stdio redirect to the output file along with the
                --silent flag,

                and instead use the -o parameter to output the response to the

                appropriate file on success. This allows the status code and
                response to

                be shown in the logs upon failure.

              hash: aeab6a6b030bd6d0047a92dcc8d41fd9e542ffe7
              body: >
                Main NetworkManager recipe was migrated to match latest one from

                meta-openembedded, so that all improvements are merged now.


                Excluded from it are `iwd` and `dhcpcd` daemon configurations
                that are

                not used by us.


                Default NM firewall in meta-openembedded is `nftables` where we
                are still

                using `iptables`.


                The new recipe relies on `meson` as a build system now.


                The .bbapend file that contains modifications specific to balena
                is preserved.

                Only `balena-client-id.patch` is removed as it references code
                that no longer

                exists. This is because the internal systemd DHCPv4 client code
                that NM used

                is now replaced by nettools' n-dhcp4 implementation.


                Closes #2872

                Current resolvconf version is broken for kirkstone, which is
                fixed upstream,

                so we reuse the fixed version from upstream.


                The symptom is that DNS servers provided by DHCP are not being
                used.

                When unlocking LUKS devices, udev events initializing the DM
                devices are still

                generated in the background even after cryptsetup luksOpen
                returns. We need to

                wait for the udev processing to finish before killing udev and
                cleaning up

                the udev database to avoid having to deal with partially
                initialized devices

                or corrupted udev database in the target OS.

                Our initramfs is built into the kernel, which is always
                compressed.

                Disable redundant initramfs compression, which should save some
                CPU

                cycles during build and boot, as well as improving compression
                ratio.

              body: >
                In the current state the cryptsetup initrd script tries to
                unlock all

                LUKS volumes in the system using the TPM. This includes
                user-defined LUKS

                volumes that, if present, fail to unlock and make the system
                unbootable.

                We should also not touch user-defined volumes in the first
                place.


                This patch modifies the cryptsetup script to only unlock LUKS
                volumes

                that are on the OS drive (same block device as the EFI
                partition).

                Enabling CONFIG_KERNEL_ZSTD=y improves the compression ratio
                compared

                to gzip while being faster to decompress. With kernel 5.15 in
                balenaOS

                v2.105, we see the 24 MB kernel compress to approximately 19 MB.


                Zstd support was added in commit 48f7ddf, first introduced in
                kernel

                v5.9. Enable this config unconditionally in supported kernels.


                Note that not every architecture and device support this option,
                but in

                those cases, Kconfig will automatically disable it as HAVE_ZSTD
                is also

                missing.

                        let's reduce it to 30 times because the resolveLocalTarget which we call will
                        timeout too in 15 seconds:

                        https://github.com/balena-os/leviathan-worker/blob/master/lib/helpers/index.ts#L162

                        So reducing the retries number to 30 will effectly bring the total combined timeout to a maximum of 8 minutes.

                Given that testbot devices use a tunnel to specific ports to
                communicate

                with the DUT that is established with the suite-generated keys,
                using

                a different keypair for the ssh-auth test would require to tear
                down and

                re-establish the tunnel.


                It's easier to just use the existing key pair in the ssh-auth
                test.

                Using two set of keys, the one created by the suite to
                authenticate by

                the proxy and a new custom key, is tricky as when running on
                testbot the

                key is used to establish the tunnel between core and DUT.


                Revert this change in preparation to removing the custom key and

                modifying the tests to use a single key.


                This reverts commit b24d92774a67cf0c0b83a29848bdcf6ed8a574db.

        This description is not very clear about the reason
        for masking the package, so let's bring this package
        back into the OS so that wireless-regdb gets included.

                When adding a kernel configuration conditional in a provided

                version, make the check include the provided kernel version as

                the intuitive way to understand it.

                commit 83f96efdfd2d (examples: harden systemd services)


                This commits works around it by allowing all members of the

                control group to send notification messages.

                which is created by the cloud suite to SSH via the proxy server,
                and

                a custom key stored in `/root/test_id` used in some of the
                subtests.


                Fix the test cases using the custom key to use the correct
                private key.

                configuration and starting the `openvpn` service unit.


                As the `openvpn` service units stops `os-config`, it might not
                get to

                restart the supervisor.


                This commit checks that `os-config` is not already active before

                starting it.

                The sshd daemon is configured to fetch keys from the API for
                local

                user connections. The script that fetches the keys,
                cloud-public-sshkeys,

                sources balena-config-vars and is run as an exclusive non-root
                user.


                Let's set the correct permissions for this file to allow not to
                break

                the above.


                Also, add a test to check that the SSH authentication with user

                registered keys does not break again.


                Fixes #2785

              body: >
                Yocto builds will abort due to inconsistencies between the
                pseudo

                database and files modified outside of the pseudo context [0].


                This will occasionally cause builds to fail in the do_deploy
                step of the

                kernel-devsrc recipe. [1]


                Fix this by not removing the kernel_source tarball in the
                do_deploy

                step.


                Fixes: https://github.com/balena-os/meta-balena/issues/2806

                The old test no longer matches on full disk paths including
                /dev, which

                can potentially result in the installation disk not being
                excluded from

                the pool of installation targets.


                Fix the comparison so that the installation disk will not be

                overwritten.

                This config file hasn't been used since commit 2db88c2, which
                unified

                how managed and unmanaged images operate. Since that commit,
                openvpn

                starts up if the config file at /etc/openvpn/openvpn.conf is
                found, and

                otherwise remains inactive. This file is populated by os-config.


                Remove the old config to prevent misdirection and cleanup the
                layer.

              hash: 5fd19e26d35d7160e2531277a9a14e194d0b95c6

                Chronyd checks that the directory specified as `sourcedir` in `chrony.conf`
                (in this case `/var/chrony`) is not world accessible if it exists (chrony
                will create it correctly if it does not exist), and does not start
                if that's the case.

                The way that the `/var/chrony` is created when it does not exist opens
                the possibility of the directory existing with the wrong permissions and
                hitting this problem.

                This commit creates the directory with the correct permissions from the
                start to avoid the race condition.

                It also changes the permissiong from 750 to 770 to match what chrony
                does (see
                https://github.com/mlichvar/chrony/blob/7b197953e8add5515b7e58c4638dc55aa4bb91b7/conf.c#L1761)

        Looks like imx-boot is actually loaded from the hw
        partition mmcblk2boot0. It is loaded from mmcblk2
        only in recovery mode, with the sd-card in the
        recovery adapter.

        Remove imx-boot-${MACHINE}-sd.bin-flash_evk from boot

        flasher image. The boot.scr is the script that re-writes
        the bootloader using the USB as source

        In order to be able to flash the iot-gate-imx8,

        This will be done by u-boot-script which will
        load a script that will do that automatically
        without the need for user intervention
